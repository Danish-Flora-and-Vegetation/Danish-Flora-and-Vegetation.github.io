This includes 1.757 that have been sampled at least once. 3.1 Number of plots per species If we take into account in how many plots a species has been detected at list once, this is the list of the species in Denmark ordered by the number of occurrences it has, note that using the search bar you can search for only one family. You can also download this list or any other table within this document with the buttons above, as well as set the number of species to be shown, you can see 100 most common species in red letters and yellow background. You can also explore the following interactive plot, you can choose to show all families, or click on any of the ones which has one of the 500 most common species to get an overview of their composition, and check the number of occurrence per species, by hovering over the plot. You can play with the controls wher you can download the images or the data within the graph. Also in the following interactive plot, you can check the distribution of the species occurrences abundance, note the distribution of rare and common species, you can zoom in and out, and hover over the bars to identify the species. You can also download the image using the camera icon 3.2 Number of species per family The number of species per family in a decreasing order are as follows: Again, in the following plot, play around with the graph, to check the distribution of the species number, zoom in and out, and explore the families with most and least amount of species 3.3 Number of species per Genus The number of species per genus is as follows: "],["cross.html", "Chapter 4 Cross-references 4.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 4.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 4 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 4.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 4. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 4.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 8.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
